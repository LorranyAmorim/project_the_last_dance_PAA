## **The Last Dance - Project for the Algorithm Design and Analysis Course**

- This repository contains the code developed for the project "The Last Dance", part of the Algorithm Design and Analysis course taught by Professor Rodrigo Cesar Pedrosa at the Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto (UFOP).

- **The project consists of several practical exercises organized into folders. Each folder includes:**
  - The corresponding algorithm's code.
  - Tree test cases.
  - A cost analysis to evaluate the algorithm's complexity.

- **Project Structure**
  - c1) Divide and Conquer Algorithm - Implementation of a binary tree and its traversal algorithms: Pre-order, Post-order, and In-order.
  - c2) Dynamic Programming Algorithm - Implementation of two algorithms using dynamic programming to solve the knapsack problem.
  - c3) Greedy Algorithms - Implementation of Kruskal's algorithm.
  - c4) Backtracking Algorithm - Implementation of a backtracking-based algorithm for the n-queens problem.
  - c5) Branch and Bound Algorithm - Implementation of a branch and bound algorithm for the knapsack problem.
