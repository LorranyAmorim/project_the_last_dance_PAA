The Last Dance - Project for the Algorithm Design and Analysis Course

This repository contains the code developed for the project "The Last Dance", part of the Algorithm Design and Analysis course taught by Professor Rodrigo Cesar Pedrosa at the Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto (UFOP).

The project consists of several practical exercises organized into folders. Each folder includes:
  ●  The corresponding algorithm's code.
  ●  Three test cases.
  ●  A cost analysis to evaluate the algorithm's complexity.
